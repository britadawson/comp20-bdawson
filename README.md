This repository holds all of my work for the spring 2019 Tufts comp 20 web development course. The projects include responsive design, practice with event listeners, work with the Google Maps API, back-end work on a server, and a security report. 

## Favorite project
My favorite project was liftknockoff because I think that is when I grew the most as a web developer. I worked with things that I was not familiar or comfortable with, like JavaScript and the Google Maps API, but in doing so, I've become more comfortable using both and using other APIs for future work. It was also very satisfying to see my work turn into something real.

## Growth: From Day 1 to Now
Prior to this course I had no knowledge of HTML or CSS, but now I've made interactive websites, gained familiarity with JavaScript, and learned how information is shared through requests and responses. I think I have grown a lot throughout this course in a few different ways. I became comfortable working with code (it has been a few semesters since I took comp15). Most importantly, I learned how to ask for help. I worked with other students, friends, and TAs to figure out challenging aspects of the labs and projects, which is something that I was uncomfortable doing when I took comp11 and comp15. 

## Most important thing I learned in comp20
I alluded to this above, but the most important thing I learned is how to ask for help. In prior computer science classes I didn't ask for help because I was scared of judgment and I wasn't motivated enough. However, this semester I collaborated with other students when we were struggling with labs or assignments and I attended office hours a few times. One of the first times I needed help with something in this course, I worked with one of my computer science friends who took this course a few years ago. As I got more comfortable asking for help, I started asking other students who I didn't know as well for help and attended office hours. Whether I work with software in the future, this is still one of the most valuable things I learned in the course because it can be applied in any aspect of life. 

## Future topics for learning
Now that I have completed comp20, I would like to learn more about security and how to make my websites more secure. This course made me realize how important it is and how often websites have security vulnerabilities.

README for assignment 2 // Brita Dawson

Collaborators: 
Johanna Ross and I talked through the initial HTTP POST request. I asked Jordan Nagy for clarification on parsing JSON data. To convert meters to miles, I used information from this website: https://www.metric-conversions.org/length/meters-to-miles.htm. I also browsed on Piazza and StackOverflow when I was confused about various things (Google maps API, HTTP POST, js objects, etc.). 

Hours worked: 10ish 

Implementation: 
Everything works properly to the best of my knowledge. Some of my functions are very lengthy, but I think everything works. I tried to get my own API key, but every time I tried to use it I got an ApiNotActivatedMapError, so I used the one Ming provided. I set up billing for my API key and confirmed my account, so I'm not sure why I kept getting that error.
